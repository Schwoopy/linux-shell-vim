## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-24

### Added
- **User-scope fallbacks** when system repos donâ€™t provide packages:
  - `yamllint` via `python3 -m pip install --user yamllint`
  - **Nerd Fonts** (default: FiraCode) to `~/.local/share/fonts` with `fc-cache -fv`
- **kubectl/oc installers**:  
  - Install to `/usr/local/bin` if writable, else fallback to `~/.local/bin`  
  - Generate completions into `~/.bash_completion.d/`
- **Repo tooling**:  
  - `Makefile` with `lint-sh`, `fmt-sh`, and `check-sh` targets  
  - `.shellcheckrc` with external source following enabled

### Changed
- **Removed EPEL dependency**: Script now works fully with base repos + user fallbacks
- **Vim plugin installation**:
  - Plugins are now cloned/updated **in parallel** (limited to CPU cores, max 8 jobs)
  - Uses `--single-branch`, `--no-tags`, and blob filtering for faster git clones
- **ble.sh installation**:
  - Compiled with **all CPU cores** (`make -jN`) instead of single-threaded builds
- **pip installs**:
  - Disabled version check and progress output (`PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1`)
  - Uses `--upgrade-strategy only-if-needed` to avoid unnecessary upgrades
  - Skips redundant `pip install --upgrade pip`
- **curl usage**:
  - All downloads now use `--compressed` to reduce bandwidth and improve speed
  - `oc` client tarball is **stream-extracted** (download + extract in one step, no temp tarball)
- **Configuration file handling**:
  - Introduced **write-if-changed** logic: files are only rewritten if content differs
  - Backups only created when actual changes are made
  - Fixed newline handling: reruns no longer prepend extra blank lines in `.bashrc` and `.vimrc`
- **kubectl/oc completions**:
  - Completions are regenerated only if the installed version changed
  - Skips rewriting if completion scripts are already up-to-date
- **Temporary files**:
  - All temp files now stored in a **single isolated directory**, cleaned on exit
- **Package installs**:
  - Quieter package manager operations (`apt-get -qq`, `dnf --setopt=tsflags=nodocs`)
  - Retries added to `apt-get` for flaky mirrors
- **Helper functions**:
  - Added `has()` and `ncores()` helpers to avoid repeated `command -v` and `nproc` calls
- **Logging**:
  - Removed progress bar; replaced with clean `[INFO]/[WARN]/[ OK ]/[ERR ]` log lines
